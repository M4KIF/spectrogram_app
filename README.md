SPECTROGRAM_APP

The idea of the project is to create a simple audio edition app
by using a few of the well known modules like:
- PyQt,
- Scipy,
- Numpy,
- Matplotlib
- PyAudio

The code is meant to load an audio file and create plots of the audio data. Available plots are: Frequency response, Spectrogram and Spectral Distribution.

The program supports both mono and stereo audio in its own way.
